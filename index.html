          <h3>About Jonathan</h3>
            <p>I have always been around computers since the days of AOL and
            had a general interest in working with software. One of my interests
            is to make and maintain websites, and to have one of my own as well.
            </p>
            <p>I am glad that I chose Thinkful because of its mentorship
            program and their career support.</p>
            <p>I'd be thrilled to work on any development projects that you have
            and if you just need a hackathon partner. Please let me know!
